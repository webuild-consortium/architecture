## About
This repository section provides the WE BUILD Conformance Specifications (CSs), defining the implementation interfaces and interoperability requirements agreed upon in the consortium.

The CSs operationalize the architectural decisions documented in the [ADRs](../adr/README.md) and are synthesized at a strategic level in the [Architecture & Integration Blueprint](../webuild-drafts/D4.1-blueprint/README.md).

## Contributing

For members of the consortium, discussions on the ADR and CS processes are held on [open social - Architecture Group](https://portal.webuildconsortium.eu/group/architecture). Pull requests always welcome! 

Reviews and approvals are currently coordinated by the [Blueprint Coordination Group](https://github.com/orgs/webuild-consortium/teams/blueprint-coordination-group).
