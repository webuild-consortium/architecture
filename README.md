## About
[Architecture decision records](adr/README.md) are lightweight architecture decision records (ADR) for each software-related decision affecting interoperability.

[Conformance Specifications (CS)](/conformance-specs/README.md) ensure interoperability and conformance by translating ADR decisions into precise implementation requirements.

[The Architecture & Integration Blueprint (D4.1)](/blueprint/README.md) provides the strategic, high-level framework that connects the detailed architectural decisions (ADRs) and conformance specifications (CSs) into a unified view of the WE BUILD architecture.
