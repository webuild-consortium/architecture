# D4.1 Architecture & Integration Blueprint Reference Document

**Authors:**  
- Sarah Amandusson, Digg

## Overview

The **Architecture & Integration Blueprint Reference Document (D4.1)** is the foundational document that establishes the high-level framework for WE BUILDs technical execution.

To manage expectations and integrate D4.1 into the existing governance structure (ADR/CS process), the Blueprint should be treated as the strategic, overarching mandate that justifies the existence and direction of subsequent, specific technical specifications.

## Background

D4.1, due in Month 7, is tasked with developing the EUDI-compliant architecture blueprint. 

## 1. Executive Summary & Project Context

Briefly describes the purpose of the Blueprint in achieving a scalable, compliant, and interoperable architectural framework for WE BUILD.

## 2. Regulatory and Foundational Alignment (Guidelines)
- Architectural principles derived from eIDAS, CIR and ARF.  
- Definition of core architectural design patterns promoting reusability and interoperability across business and citizen systems.

## 3. Core Technical Components and Interfaces (Integration Requirements)
- Overview of the integrated capabilities provided by WP4 groups (e.g., Wallet, PID/LPID, QTSP, Trust Registry).  
- High-level definitions for wallet interfaces and communication protocols for issuers/verifiers (further detailed in the subsequent Conformance Specifications).

## 4. Data and Semantics Integration
- Strategy for achieving semantically interoperable electronic attestations and data models (aligning with the **Semantics Group / T4.2**).  
- How the Blueprint supports use case–specific data needs, referencing the upcoming **Attestations Data Models & PID/LPID Issuance Rulebook (D4.3, Month 10)**.

## 5. Architectural Governance and Lifecycle
- Formal description of the **ADR process** for strategic decision-making and justification of major technical choices.  
- Description of the **CS process** for dictating implementations and ensuring conformance within the consortium.  
- Integration with the **Interoperability Testbed (ITB)**, defining how the architecture enables robust testing and validation (aligning with the **Testing Group / T4.5**).
