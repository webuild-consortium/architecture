# D4.1 Architecture & Integration Blueprint

The **Architecture & Integration Blueprint (D4.1)** provides the strategic, high-level framework that connects the detailed architectural decisions (ADRs) and conformance specifications (CSs) into a unified view of the WE BUILD architecture.

It is maintained by the [Blueprint Coordination Group](https://github.com/orgs/webuild-consortium/teams/blueprint-coordination-group).

## Purpose
The Blueprint synthesises approved ADRs and CSs to:
- Maintain architectural coherence across WP4 and the Large-Scale Pilots.
- Provide a simplified, strategic view of the architecture for external stakeholders.
- Support traceability between governance artefacts and implementations.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| [Blueprint Process](./blueprint-process.md) | Describes how the Blueprint is maintained, including BCG’s role and relation to ADR/CS workflows. |
| [Proposed Outline](./blueprint-outline.md) | Suggested chapter structure for D4.1 and how content will evolve. |


## Relation to Other Processes
- [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](/adr/README.md) capture architectural reasoning and decisions.  
- [Conformance Specifications (CSs)](/cs/README.md) define technical implementations and interoperability rules.  
- The Blueprint consolidates both into a single reference architecture.
