# WE BUILD – Architecture & Integration Blueprint (D4.1)

The **Architecture & Integration Blueprint (D4.1)** provides the strategic, high-level framework that connects the detailed architectural decisions (ADRs) and conformance specifications (CSs) into a unified view of the WE BUILD architecture.

It is maintained by the [Blueprint Coordination Group](https://github.com/orgs/webuild-consortium/teams/blueprint-coordination-group).

## Purpose
The Blueprint synthesises approved ADRs and CSs to:
- Maintain architectural coherence across WP4 and the Large-Scale Pilots.
- Provide a simplified, strategic view of the architecture for external stakeholders.
- Support traceability between governance artefacts and implementations.

| Document | Description |

| [Blueprint Process](./blueprint.md) | Suggested chapter structure for D4.1 and how content will evolve. |

## Relation to Other Processes
- [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](./adr/README.md) capture architectural reasoning and decisions.  
- [Conformance Specifications (CSs)](./conformance-specs/README.md) define technical implementations and interoperability rules.  
- The Blueprint consolidates both into a single reference architecture.
